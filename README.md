1. Summary/About
   Basically, I was pretty tired with the limited solutions available online for
   doing unique word counts as they didn't have many options for controlling any
   of the clean up options for the text input, nor did they show what was done
   to the input post-processing, nor were their any graphing or other possibly
   useful data formats. So, I built something a little fancier, then tried to
   make it look decent and modern. I'm still working on it.
