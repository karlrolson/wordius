1. Summary/About
Basically, I was pretty tired with the limited solutions available online for 
doing unique word counts as they didn't have many options for controlling any
of the clean up options for the text input, nor did they show what was done 
to the input post-processing, nor were their any graphing or other possibly 
useful data formats. So, I built something a little fancier, then tried to 
make it look decent and modern. I'm still working on it.
